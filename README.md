# Alight-Coding-Challenge
Details on Test
Challenge Overview
This challenge consists of two parts: a HackerRank test and a web development project. Your skills in both algorithmic problem-solving and web development will be assessed.

  🔖Part 1: HackerRank Test
HackerRank Test: You will complete a series of 3 algorithmic questions on HackerRank. The questions will cover topics such as data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving skills. Once you have completed this test, proceed to Part 2.

  🔖Part 2: Web Development Project
* Google Front Page Clone:
  - Objective: Create a clone of the Google front page.
  - Technology Stack: Use JavaScript or TypeScript with the React library.
  - Design Requirements:
     - Ensure the design closely mimics the current Google homepage.
     - Implement a search functionality using any random API for searching data.
     - Responsiveness: The webpage should be responsive and accessible across different devices including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
     - Additional Features: Feel free to add any additional features or enhancements that you think would improve the user experience.

Requirements
🔖Part 1: HackerRank Test
Complete the three algorithmic questions provided in the HackerRank test.
🔖Part 2: Web Development Project

 - Frontend Requirements:
      - Clone the Google front page using React.
      - Implement a search bar that uses a random API to fetch and display search results.
      - Ensure the design is fully responsive and looks good on all device sizes.
      - Use modern React practices, such as hooks and functional components.
      - Write a clean, maintainable, and well-documented codebase.

Backend Requirements (Optional Bonus):
If you choose to add backend functionality, you can create a simple Node.js/Express server that serves the search results from the chosen API.

📄Submission Guidelines

      - Project Repository: Your project should be hosted on an online repository such as GitHub or GitLab.

  - README File: Include a detailed README file with the following information:
    Overview of the project.
      - Technologies used.
      - Installation instructions.
      - Steps to run the project.
      - Explanation of the code structure.
      - Any additional features or considerations.
      - Deadline: The completed project must be submitted by 15 July 2024 at noon time.

👷🏽‍♀️Best Practices
      -Follow best coding practices, including proper variable naming, code modularity, and commenting.
      -Ensure the application is properly logged and errors are handled gracefully.
      -Avoid hardcoding any sensitive information; use environment variables where necessary.
      -Apply appropriate validation, especially for user inputs.
      -Document your API if you have implemented any backend functionality (e.g., using Swagger or Postman).
      -Ensure your application is well-tested, with clear instructions on how to run the tests.

✨Bonus Points
  - Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure that the application looks and works well on smaller screens.
  - Additional Features: Adding useful features or enhancements to improve the user experience.
